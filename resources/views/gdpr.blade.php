We acknowledge your consent when you voluntarily sign and date the sample donor section, sign and date the alcohol screen results and similarly the drug testing results section.  As outlined in your employer/ agencies policies a refusal / deliberate attempt to tamper with the samples or delay testing may constitute a breach of your employment and would therefore be actioned as a refusal. <br>
            <p>Similarly as you are able to refuse consent, you are also within your rights to withdraw consent after you have agreed to it. You can do this by informing the tester throughout the process of your intention to withdrawal. </p>
