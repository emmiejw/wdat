        <p class="flow-text"><b>Did you know that the availability and usage of drugs and alcohol is on the rise?</b>  <br> Consequently, this is leading to an increased risk of substance abuse in the work place. If left unmonitored, this can lead to massive implications for your business and employees.  Research has shown that drugs and alcohol usage severely impair performance on the simplest of tasks. <br>
        In a high risk industry like construction, drugs and alcohol misuse at work are <b>NOT</b> compatible.  <br>
        Info and stats to consider; <br>

        <p class="flow-text"><b>Are you aware of the legalities of drugs and alcohol misuse in the workplace?</b> <br>
        The Transport and Works Act 1992 deems it a criminal offense for certain workers to be unfit through drink/drugs, while working on railways, tramways and any other guided transport system. Employers/ operators could be guilty of an offense, unless they have shown all due diligence in preventing offences being committed.  <br>
        The Road and Traffic Act 1988 states "Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle, on a road or other public place, or when in charge of a motor vehicle on a road or other public place whilst unfit to drive through drink or drugs is guilty of an offence". <br>
        Under the Health and Safety Act 1974, employers have the legal duty to ensure the health, safety and welfare of employees. <br>
        If an employer is aware of an employee under the influence of alcohol/drug misuse and allows them to work or continue to work after being alerted and their behaviour places the employee or others at risk, the employer could be prosecuted. <br>
        <b> If an employer feels a justifiable Health and Safety risk, how should they implement a drug and alcohol testing policy? </b> <br>
        You must ensure that an appropriate alcohol, drugs and substance abuse policy forms part of your overall Health and Safety Policy (We can support you in this process). Once established, we can facilitate the rest...

        <p class="flow-text"><b>How can we support your business?</b> <br>
            WDAT pride ourselves on our client centred service, in particular our clients say we operate in an extremely dignified manner, which ensures a private and confidential service. No procedure commences without prior consent from each donor (employee to be tested). Each donor receives a declaration (consent form) which they will read through, have the opportunity to ask questions and sign, only if they consent for the test to proceed.  <br>
          <p class="flow-text">
            WDAT utilise the most up to date point of care testing kits with the highest sensitivity, specificity and combined overall accuracy. Our multi-drug testing kits are utilised for the qualitative assessment of drugs and / or their metabolites in human urine. We carry out urine sampling using specially designed drug of abuse testing devices including either a split key cup (tamper proof) which tests for 10 prolific drugs and/ or standard drug of abuse cups. Our testing kits have built in temperature strips, adulteration checks and are tamper proof (point of care split key cups). <br>
            <p class="flow-text" class="flow-text">Clients can also request a back to lab 'Chain of Custody' drug test, which we send to the lab for confirmation. Please note this is charged at a seperate rate per drug tested. This will confirm the drug metabolites found in the sample, the level identified and whether this corresponds or contradicts any prescribed medication that the donor currently takes. WDAT uses a <b>Home Office approved Draegar 5820 breathalyser</b> to measure ethanol in a sample of breath, these are carried out as standard with any drug test. </p>
            <p class="flow-text">We currently use two types of Point of Care tests, clients can choose which set is preferential to their workforce.</p>

        <h4>Results within 5 minutes!</h4>
        <p class="flow-text"><b>What do the urine sampling results mean?</b> <br>
        Urine drug sampling will produce a negative or non-negative result (where metabolites have identified in the urine). Our drug testing kits will detect drug metabolites in the urine, which will be highlighted by the membrane panel built into the cups. The results will either identify a 'negative' or' non-negative' result. If the result is 'Negative' it highlights our drug kits have found no metabolites (drug) in the urine. 'Non-negative' results indicate drug metabolites have been found in the urine. If a non-negative result is produced, (meaning drug metabolites have been found in the urine) there are 3 options: <br>
        In light of the analysed results (including analyses of the temperature and adulteration strips) there are three outcomes to consider;   <br>
        <ul  class="flow-text">
            <li ><img src="images/option1.png" style="height:25px; width:25px;  margin-right: 15px;">The donor is happy with this result, is therefore in agreement with the substances found in their urine and signs the declaration form.</li> <br>
            <li><img src="images/option1.png" style="height:25px; width:25px;  margin-right: 15px;">A re-test is requested (at a further cost).</li> <br>
            <li><img src="images/option1.png" style="height:25px; width:25px;  margin-right: 15px;">A full chain of custody laboratory test is performed to finalise the result <br> (please note, this incurs a further fee per individual drug tested). </li>
        </ul>
        <p  class="flow-text">
                <b>What do the breathalyser sampling results mean?</b> <br>                   
                When an employee provides a sample of breath into the breathalyser,  if it is identified that the level produced is  at or above the company cut off, another test can be performed 15 minutes later. This can then be repeated up to a maximum of 3 more times in one visit. It will identify whether the employees micrograms of ethanol per 100ml of breath is reducing, increasing or staying the same.  The current UK driving limit is 35(.35) microgrammes per 100ml of breath. <br>
                As a company you will need to make a safety concious judgement (which must be reflected and explicitly written in your Drugs and Alcohol Policy) about the level at which employees are fit for work. Some employers decide to set their company cut off levels at 22 microgrammes per 100ml of breath. However, please note this is NOT applicable or suitable for employees working on railways, tramways and any other guided transport system, where guidance states the breathalyser levels should be 0 .
