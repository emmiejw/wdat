        <p class="flow-text"><b>Did you know that the availability and usage of drugs and alcohol is on the rise?</b>  <br> Consequently this is leading to an increased risk of substance abuse in the work place. If left unmonitored, this can lead to massive implications for your business and employees.  Research has shown that drugs and alcohol usage severely impairs performance on the simplest of tasks. <br>
        In a high risk industry like construction, drugs and alcohol misuse and work are <b>NOT</b> compatible.  <br>

        <p class="flow-text"><b>Are you aware of the legalities of drugs and alcohol misuse in the workplace?</b> <br>
        The Transport and Works Act 1992 deems it a criminal offense for certain workers to be unfit through drink/drugs, while working on railways, tramways and any other guided transport system. Employers/ operators could be guilty of an offense, unless they have shown all due diligence in preventing offences being committed.  <br>
        The Road and Traffic Act 1988 states "Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle, on a road or other public place, or when in charge of a motor vehicle on a road or other public place whilst unfit to drive through drink or drugs is guilty of an offence". <br>
        Under the Health and Safety Act 1974, employers have the legal duty to ensure the health, safety and welfare or employees. <br>
        If an employer is aware of an employee under the influence of alcohol/drug misuse and allows them to work or continue to work after being alerted and their behaviour places the employee or others at risk, the employer could be prosecuted. <br>
        <b> If an employer feels a justifiable Health and Safety risk, how should they implement a drug and alcohol testing policy? </b> <br>
        You must ensure that an appropriate alcohol, drugs and substance abuse policy forms part of your overall Health and Safety Policy (We can support you in this process). Once established, we can facilitate the rest...

        <p class="flow-text"><b>How can we support your business?</b> <br>
          We are a extremely dignified, private and confidential company. No procedure commences without our testers ensuring the donor (employee) understands the tests involved and is happy to sign the declaration/consent form. We perform urine sampling using the most up to date 10 split key membranes, with adulteration, testing cups ( this enables us to perform a chain of custody laboratory test if a non-negative result is found)  and a Home Office approved Draegar 5820 breathalyser. Guidance procedural notes are forwarded to site managers/ contracts managers prior to our visit. Your company is responsible for setting the company cut of level for which you deem fit for work. All results must remain confidential to adhere with data protection laws (Please see our GDPR policy). <br> <br>
          <b class="flow-text"><a href="#contact">Contact Us</a> and we can support you through our recommended testing procedures and the benefits this can bring to your company. </b>

        <p class="flow-text"><b>So what do the results mean?</b> <br>
        Most samples are negative for substances. However, if a non-negative result is produced, there are 3 options: <br>
        <ul  class="flow-text">
            <li ><img src="images/options.png" style="height:25px; width:25px;  margin-right: 15px;">The donor is happy with this result, is therefore in agreement with the substances found in their urine and signs the declaration form.</li>
            <li><img src="images/options.png" style="height:25px; width:25px;  margin-right: 15px;">A re-test is requested ( at a further cost).</li>
            <li><img src="images/options.png" style="height:25px; width:25px;  margin-right: 15px;">A full chain of custody laboratory test is performed to finalise the result ( please note this incurs a further fee per individual drug tested). </li>
        </ul>
        <p  class="flow-text">
                With the breathalyser results, if a level is produced at or above the company cut off another test can be performed 15 minutes later. This can then be repeated upto a maximum of 3 more times in one visit. This will identify whether the employees micrograms of ethanol per 100ml of breath is reducing, increasing or staying the same.  The current UK driving limit is 35(.35) micrograms per 100ml of breath. <br>
                As a company you will need to make a safety concious judgement (which must be reflected and explicitly written in your Drugs and Alcohol Policy) the level at, which employees are fit for work, significant amount of companies set it at 22mg per 100ml of breath, please not this is NOT applicable or suitable for employees working on railways, tramways and any other guided transport system, where guidance states the breathalyser levels should be 0 .
