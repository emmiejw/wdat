                <p>Breath can be tested for alcohol using handheld devices which provide immediate results. These devices are specific to alcohol and can gage blood alcohol content (BAC) by measuring deep lung air. This type of testing can accurately determine whether a person has recently consumed alcohol or is currently over the legal or pre-determined limit. These instruments are simple to use, accurate and robust and have a variety of functions including the ability to test passive, direct or liquid samples as well as breath expelled into a container. We use a Home Office approved Draegar 5820 for added accuracy. </p>
                <p><b>How it works:</b><br>
                    When alcohol is consumed it is absorbed into the bloodstream. When the blood reaches the lungs a small amount of alcohol (in proportion to the concentration in the blood) transfers into the alveoli. This is then passed out of the body when the person exhales. A breathalyser is then able to measure this concentration and give a reading. <br>
                    The legal drink drive limit is 35 microgrammes  per 100ml of breath. Each company should state in their Health and Safety Policy (Drug and Alcohol section) their agreed company limit of micrograms of ethanol per 100ml of breath, whilst at work. We can then report the result and re-assess further if necessary. If a donor produces a higher result than is company policy upon re-assessment, we can determine whether this result is going up (further alcohol has been consumed) or coming down (ethanol is reducing in the body).

                <p>Urine is the most common sample type for drug and alcohol testing. Simple and practical to obtain, it offers short-term drug abuse  profiling. Urine samples are most commonly used to detect recent illegal drug use. It is considered non-intrusive, cost effective and the quickest method for  sample collection. <b>Results within 5 minutes!</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>How it works:</b><br>
                    Once a drug is consumed, the end product looks much different once it has been passed through the body. Drugs enter the body in psychedelic form and level as a metabolite. A urine test is able to detect the metabolites and deliver a confirmatory report indicating their presence though drug-protein conjugates. Tests can be conducted instantly, or samples can be collected and sent to our laboratory for more in-depth analysis. We use the most up to date and tested membranes using a 10 drug split key and test for: <br>

                    All our drug testers are able to check for adulteration.  Our drug test pots are able to detect that the sample has not been adulterated through  the use of a temperature gage (a green colour will appear to indicate the temperature of the urine specimen. The proper range for an unadulterated specimen is 32-38). Our urine sampling pots also identify 'OX' Oxidants/'PCC' Pyridinium Chlorochromate, which test for the presence of oxidising agents such as bleach and hydrogen peroxide. Normal urine should not contain oxidants or PCC; Results will read low/high (abnormal) or normal. Secondly we can also identify 'SG' Specific Gravity, which test for sample solution. Normal levels are 1.003-1.030 therefore values outside this range maybe the result of dilution or adulterates. Finally PH (acidity/alkalinity) the higher the number the more basic (alkaline) the sample is, the lower the number the moe acidic, with neutral being 7. The normal range for urine sample is between 4-9. Levels above and below this could indicate that the sample has been tampered with. <br>
                    <b>What does this mean?</b> <br>
                    Using the most up to date scientifically tested and approved urine sampling methods, we are able to ensure no masking agents or dilution have taken place, e.g. adding bleach/hydrogen peroxide, diluting with water or attempting to alter the PH of the urine.
