                <p>Breath can be tested for alcohol using handheld devices which provide immediate results. These devices are specific to alcohol and can gauge blood alcohol content (BAC) by measuring deep lung air. This type of testing can accurately determine whether a person has recently consumed alcohol or is currently over the legal or pre-determined limit. These instruments are simple to use, accurate and robust and have a variety of functions including the ability to test passive, direct or liquid samples as well as breath expelled into a container. We use a Home Office approved Draegar 5820 for added accuracy. </p>
                <p><b>How it works:</b><br>
                    When alcohol is consumed it is absorbed into the bloodstream. When the blood reaches the lungs a small amount of alcohol (in proportion to the concentration in the blood) transfers into the alveoli. This is then passed out of the body when the person exhales. A breathalyser is then able to measure this concentration and give a reading. <br>
                    The legal drink drive limits is 35mg per 100ml of breath. Each company should state in their Health and Safety Policy (Drug and Alcohol section) their agreed company limit of micrograms of ethanol per 100ml of breath, whilst at work. We can then report the result and re-assess further if necessary. If a donor produces a higher result than is company policy upon re-assessment, we can determine whether this result is going up ( further alcohol has been consumed) or coming down (ethanol is reducing in the body).

                <p>Urine is the most common sample type for drug and alcohol testing. Simple and practical to obtain, it offers short-term drug abuse  profiling. Urine samples are most commonly used to detect recent illegal drug use. It is considered non-intrusive, cost effective and the quickest method for  sample collection.
                </p>
                <p><b>How it works:</b><br>
                    Once a drug is consumed, the end product looks much different once it has been passed through the body. Drugs enter the body in psychedelic form and level as a metabolite. A urine test is able to detect the metabolites and deliver a confirmatory report indicating their presence though drug-protein conjugates. Tests can be conducted instantly, or samples can be collected and sent for our laboratory for more in-depth analysis. We use the most up to date and tested membranes using a 10 drug split key and test for: <br>

                    All our drug testers are able to check for adulteration (PH, GH and temperature).  <br>
                    <b>What does this mean?</b> <br>
                    Using the most up to date scientifically tested and approved urine sampling methods, we are able to ensure no masking agents or dilution have taken place, e.g. adding bleach/hydrogen peroxide, diluting with water or attempting to alter the PH of the urine.
